This will be my fist blog eventhough I want to build a site for a long time.

The site is hosted by GitHub Pages with help from Jekll Bootstap.

Jekyll is a static site generator that let you to blog like a hacker.

I fell it cool.

I will blog my favorite thing about the codes, programing,Photography,
and the life with my pretty Louise.
